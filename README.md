Open and Up v1

Overview — This repo contains the files for an app created to share stories, music, books, podcasts, and events that uplift people.

In this world where we are addicted to our phones and grab them to scroll through our social media accounts when we have the slightest bit of down time or waiting, Open and Up is a place where users can go to scroll through positive stories and uplifting ideas.

Users will be able to create an account and then post personal stories (280 characters or less); links to music; titles and short descriptions of books; titles, links, and short descriptions of podcasts; and links to events that are positive and uplifting. Users can bookmark others' posts and follow other users - they cannot comment on other users' posts or like other posts.
